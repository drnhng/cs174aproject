## Theme/Story
Bruinwalk is a 3D animated game. You, the player, are a bear trying to cross a busy street at UCLA. You must navigate through a field cluttered with obstacles, including rocks, trees, and vehicles. You lose if you are struck by a vehicle, in which the game ends. If you make it to the finish line on the other side, you win.

## How to Play
1. Launch the game and navigate to the start screen.
2. Press 'P' to begin.
3. Use arrow keys to move the bear across the field.
4. Avoid moving vehicles and navigate around static obstacles.
5. Reach the other side of the field to win.

## Features
- **3D Geometric Modeling**: All elements including characters, obstacles, and environments are built using 3D geometric shapes.
- **Camera Control**: A dynamic camera viewpoint follows the player's movement.
- **Matrix Transformations**: Utilize translation matrices for moving obstacles and character navigation.
- **Coordinate System**: Determines the movement and position of objects in the game environment.
- **Texture Mapping**: ASCII character mapping for displaying text.
